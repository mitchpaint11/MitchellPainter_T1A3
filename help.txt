Hello again, if you need some help, this guide should help.

Woofz is a dog walkers management Application, by navigating through this app, it will allow you to view, select and confirm
from a range of dog walking jobs, allowing you to choose which dog you would like to walk and find out how much you will be 
paid for walking your chosen dog.

NOTE: Please ensure your terminal is set to FULLSCREEN while using this application, to avoid any layout issues or confusion. Thank you!

The application will prompt you to type directly into the terminal. 
When this happens please enter the information required and press enter to continue.
You will be provided with options numbered 1-5 and asked to enter a corresponding number to the option you have chosen.
If the application cannot accept your input, you will recieve a message, "Invalid entry, Try again!"
It will then display the valid input options and allow you to try again.
If you enter an invalid option you will again be displayed the main menu and asked to try again!

When prompted with return/enter - "Press return/enter on your keyboard to continue.."
When prompted with Y/N ? - "Type Y for YES and N for NO.."

Thank you, Have a nice day!
